    "## Support Vector Machines, overarching aims\n",
    "\n",
    "A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful and versatile\n",
    "Machine Learning method, capable of performing linear or nonlinear\n",
    "classification, regression, and even outlier detection. It is one of\n",
    "the most popular models in Machine Learning, and anyone interested in\n",
    "Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are\n",
    "particularly well suited for classification of complex but small-sized or\n",
    "medium-sized datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The case with two well-separated classes only can be understood in an\n",
    "intuitive way in terms of lines in a two-dimensional space separating\n",
    "the two classes (see figure below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic mathematics behind the SVM is however less familiar to most of us. \n",
    "It relies on the definition of hyperplanes and the\n",
    "definition of a **margin** which separates classes (in case of\n",
    "classification problems) of variables. It is also used for regression\n",
    "problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "With SVMs we distinguish between hard margin and soft margins. The\n",
    "latter introduces a so-called softening parameter to be discussed\n",
    "below.  We distinguish also between linear and non-linear\n",
    "approaches. The latter are the most frequent ones since it is rather\n",
    "unlikely that we can separate classes easily by say straight lines."

    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
